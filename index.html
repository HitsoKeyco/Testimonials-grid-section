        <p class="biograp_daniel">" I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a
          transition and have some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for 
          the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
          weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've 
          successfully switched careers, working as a Sofware  Engineer at a VR stratup."

        <p class="biograp_kira">" Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed
        some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged
        to enroll by a former student of their who can only say wonderful things about the program. the entire
        curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for 
        assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next
        level in away that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews 
        as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving
        multiple offer. 100% recommended "
